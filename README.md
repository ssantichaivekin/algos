# algos

I will put my algorithm library here. All the algorithms here will be well documented and will have test cases and test case generators to demonstrate the algorithms.

Here are the list of what I have written :

- Union Find Disjoint Set
  - Support amortized O(log n) for union and find. We do not implement union by rank.
  - Support finding all elements a the set using BFS in amortized(log n + k) where k is the size of the result set.

I'm thinking of writing and documenting:

- Gaussian elimination and its variations
- Syntax tree parser
- solving 2SAT
