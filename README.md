# algos

I will put my algorithm library here. All the algorithms here will be well documented and will have test cases and test case generators to demonstrate the algorithms.

Here are the list of what I have written + documented :

- Union Find Disjoint Set
- Fenwick Tree: simple version
- Fenwick Tree: max in range version
- Heap

Written without test case generators :

- Quickselect (no test case generator yet)
- Mock file system (no test case generator yet)
- Binary search for the answer

Ongoing :

- Syntax tree parser

I'm thinking of writing and documenting:

- Gaussian elimination and its variations
- solving 2SAT
